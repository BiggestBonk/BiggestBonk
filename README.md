# Howdy, I'm Harry ðŸ‘‹
I am a motivated and enthusiastic Software Developer hailing from ÅŒtautahi Christchurch. I have experience working with React, TypeScript, NodeJS and SQLite (using Knex.js) to create accessible and intuitive web apps. I have also recently began working through a software testing course on Udemy and learning how to use Playwright, as I'm interested in learning more about the world of QA & test automation. I'm eager to get out there and start making the change I strive to see!

## A Little Bit More About Me
I have just recently completed my time studying at Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I acquired a large suite of skills and broadened my understanding of the world of web development from a technical and social perspective. Learning to make the best of modern web technologies and utilise concepts such as agile methodologies has allowed me to make practical use of my passion for problem-solving and creative mind to build applications I once thought were impossible to create. Aside from the coding, I am an avid gamer and a passionate writer with an intense adoration for literature. Where ever possible I take the opportunity to use my English skills to enhance the overall feel of whatever I'm working on, and bring forward my eye for detail through to anything I set my mind to.

## Projects
[MyCelium](https://my-celium.devacademy.nz/ "Deployed Mycellium Page") is a game project I recently developed alongside a brilliant team whilst finishing my time at Dev Academy. This project is a small farming game, where you cultivate and care for your own mushrooms before harvesting and selling them. Mushroom growth rate is determined by fertiliser level and hydratation, and your primary job as a player is to keep both of those maintained so that your mushrooms grow as fast as possible. Once they've grown to full size, you can harvest them for caps to sell at the market and replant the spores so that the cycle continues!

Sloth Library is a simple website made using React to display a list of books for a librarian that can be checked out to customers, changing their availability. The data for the books and customers are handled using Knex and SQLite3. This was also made as a group project for Dev Academy.

[Trello API](https://www.postman.com/harry-walsh/workspace/my-workspace/request/39622902-8cc13afd-e43c-41c3-8119-7bf977b3399a?action=share&creator=39622902&ctx=documentation&active-environment=39622902-761f1ad8-5fa3-4ee5-8784-36aa680a341f) is a postman collection I created to solidify my ability to test API requests. This collection tests the CRUD operations available on the Trello API for boards,lists, cards and checklists, verifying that each request is functioning as intended and returning the expected data within a reasonable time. One of my primary focuses whilst working on this project was making sure each test was robust and repeatable. I achieved this by using variables to store the IDs of each respective board, list, card etc. and then reusing said variables in the subsequent requests.
